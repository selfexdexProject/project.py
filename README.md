CryptoPlatform
A simple Python-based cryptocurrency simulation platform.

Overview
The CryptoPlatform project provides a basic simulation of cryptocurrency transactions between users. It allows for the creation of users, making transactions between them, and checking their balances.

Features
User Creation: Easily create a new user with an initial balance.
Transactions: Perform transactions between users if the sender has sufficient balance.
Balance Check: Check the balance of any user on the platform.
Transaction History: View a list of all transactions that have taken place on the platform.
Classes
CryptoTransaction
Attributes:
sender: The user sending the cryptocurrency.
receiver: The user receiving the cryptocurrency.
amount: The amount of cryptocurrency being sent.
CryptoPlatform
Attributes:



users: A dictionary containing all users and their balances.
transactions: A list containing all transactions that have taken place.
Methods:

create_user(username): Creates a new user with an initial balance of 100.
make_transaction(sender, receiver, amount): Performs a transaction between two users.
get_balance(username): Returns the balance of a user.
Usage
python
Copy code
crypto_platform = CryptoPlatform()
crypto_platform.create_user("Alice")
crypto_platform.create_user("Bob")

crypto_platform.make_transaction("Alice", "Bob", 30)

print("Alice's balance:", crypto_platform.get_balance("Alice"))
print("Bob's balance:", crypto_platform.get_balance("Bob"))

print("Transactions:")
for transaction in crypto_platform.transactions:
    print(f"{transaction.sender} sent {transaction.amount} to {transaction.receiver}")
    
Output
vbnet
Copy code
Alice's balance: 70
Bob's balance: 130
Transactions:
Alice sent 30 to Bob
Future Enhancements
Implement more advanced features like multi-signature transactions.
Integrate with a database for persistent storage of users and transactions.
Add encryption and security features.
